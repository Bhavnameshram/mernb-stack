        <h1><sup><sup><i>india</i></sup></sup>About the children </h1>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in Children’s House International’s India Program. We are proud to say that in
            2025, Children’s House is celebrating our 50th anniversary, and it all began in 1975 with India! India was
            our first program and our International Specialist, Lisa Anderson, has adopted two children from India and
            has been our India specialist for 26 years. Lisa received a Congressional Angels in Adoption Award in
            October 2015!</p>
        <input type="radio" name="NRI" id="ONE">
        <Label for="NRI">NRI:<i>One spouse is an Indian citizen and the other is a US Citizen</i></Label><br>
        <input type="radio" name="OCI" id="ONE">
        <Label for="OCI">OCI:<i>US Citizens, of which one or both parents have Overseas Citizen of India

        <p><b>NRI/OCI=</b>families are eligible to adopt a child with no known health problems. NRI/OCI families are
            treated on par with resident Indians. The current wait time for a child with no known special needs is 4+
            years. Most NRI/OCI families are open to a child with minor special needs.</p><br>
        <p><b>Foreign:</b>Families with no Indian heritage or Indian families that do not qualify as NRI or OCI. The
            reality of the program requires us to counsel foreign families to be open to considering a child with a
            minimum of moderate special needs, or a child over age 10. Applications from families hoping to adopt only
            healthy young children (unless they are NRI/OCI) will result in an indefinite wait for referral. The more
            open you are to both genders and more special needs, the faster a referral will happen.

        </p>
        <p><b>NOTE:  At least one spouse must be a US Citizen to adopt a child from a foreign country.  Unfortunately, Permanent Residents and those living and/or working in the USA under other types of visas do not qualify.</b></p>

        <P>Process Related to Adoptable ChildrenAdoption means a legal process that allows someone to become the parent
            of a child, even though the parent and child are not related by blood. But in every other way, adoptive
            parents are the child's parents.</P>
